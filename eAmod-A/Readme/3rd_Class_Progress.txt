About 3rd Class progress:
=======================================================

As you know, i use 3rd Classes from 3CeAM project but i am working on doing a Review of each class
and fixing each one according to official info and tests. Lots of improvements in the coding way
are done for each class i check.

So, for your servers, i recommend you to enable only:

Arch Bishop
Rune Knight
Warlock
Guillotine Cross
Ranger
Mechanic
Shadow Chaser

Also, you can enable all classes, but my recommendation is to block the non revised classes skills,
using the skill_block_db.txt file in /db.
